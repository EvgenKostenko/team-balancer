# Team Balancer #

We have a group of users - the team whose work capacity depends on his/her capability.  We represent this amount of work as points (_an integer_).

This team needs to complete a list of tasks. The task complexity is also represented by points. The harder the task, the higher the point.

The goal of this exercise is to find the best possible way to distribute tasks among the team so that the usersâ€™ workload is as equal as possible (to avoid the case when one employee is overworked, while another has almost nothing to do).

Every task has a name, and each user has a name.

For each user, the result should display the following as a minimum:

* User's nickname
* User's personal points
* The list of all tasks assigned to the user (name and corresponding points)
* the total amount of points assigned to the user


You can structure the data the way you see fit. 

Your solution should be represented as **class** where it is possible to create users and tasks. As result the tasks should be distributed among the users and the results should be displayed.
